# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸš€ Explore the various Applications I've developed using MERN, PHP, React Native and Flutter.

## Apps I Developed:

1. **Zakat Collection App (Eziqaat):**
   The proposed solution is an automated system for recording and auditing door-to-door
   collections of Zakat by charitable organizations. The system aims to reduce the chances of
   fraud, establish trust among donors, and provide an efficient, secure, and transparent way of
   tracking donations. The system will minimize the cost of collection, eliminate long delays, and
   enable a proper audit of transactions to maintain checks and balances of funds.

2. **Ecommerce Headphones Website:**

   specifications, users can add or remove products to the cart and also increase or decrease product quantity as
